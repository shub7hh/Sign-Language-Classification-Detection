# Sign-Language-Classification-Detection
This project implements a real-time sign language recognition system using computer vision and deep learning. Leveraging OpenCV, MediaPipe-based hand tracking (via CVZone), and a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the system can accurately classify hand gestures representing common sign language phrases.
